        \"<p>Research shows that many people come onto Universal Credit with pre-existing
        rent arrears. We also know that arrears are usually temporary and the majority
        of claimants do succeed in paying their rent, managing their monthly payments
        and clearing their arrears over time. In our research, the proportion of Universal
        Credit claimants who were in arrears at the start of their claim fell by a
        third after four months.</p>\" .\r\n<https://id.parliament.uk/c8IiPthT> <https://id.parliament.uk/schema/answerGivenDate>
